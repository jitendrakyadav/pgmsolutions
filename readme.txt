/*** Ubuntu Commands ***/

Difference between apt and apt-get: 
apt is newer version of apt-get, introduced in 16.04 
//apt is a new package manager for Ubuntu just like composer for PHP 
//Type "apt --help" to get commands of apt and "apt-get --help" to get commands of apt-get

/*** Before install any new software(refresh available updates): ***/ 
sudo apt-get update

/*** Installs newer versions of the packages you have: ***/ 
sudo apt upgrade

/*** To uninstall Software Center(In left, there is orange bag with name 'Ubuntu Software'): ***/ 
sudo apt remove software-center

/*** remove/unstall those packages which are no longer required. which were installed/used/having-dependency to install another package but after that no longer required, you may use this command after any software installation ***/ 
sudo apt autoremove

/*** To re-install Software Center(In left, there is orange bag with name 'Ubuntu Software'): ***/ 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt install software-center

/*** some packages werenâ€™t installed properly. To fix this problem: ***/ 
sudo apt-get autoclean 
(clears out the local repository of retrieved package files, but unlike apt-get clean, it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless.)

/*** One of the most basic fixes to resolve dependencies problems is to run: ***/ 
sudo apt-get -f install

/*** Apache server command: ***/ 
sudo service apache2 status 
sudo service apache2 start 
sudo service apache2 stop 
sudo service apache2 restart

/*** MySQL server command: ***/ 
sudo service mysql status 
sudo service mysql start 
sudo service mysql stop

/*** Get installed php version: ***/ 
php -v
