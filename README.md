# Ubuntu Commands
Difference between apt and apt-get:
<br>apt is newer version of apt-get, introduced in 16.04
<br>//apt is a new package manager for Ubuntu just like composer for PHP
<br>//Type "apt --help" to get commands of apt and "apt-get --help" to get commands of apt-get

/*** Before install any new software(refresh available updates): ***/
<br>**sudo apt-get update**

/*** Installs newer versions of the packages you have: ***/
<br>**sudo apt upgrade**

/*** To uninstall Software Center(In left, there is orange bag with name 'Ubuntu Software'): ***/
<br>**sudo apt remove software-center**

/*** remove/unstall those packages which are no longer required. which were installed/used/having-dependency to install another package but after that no longer required, you may use this command after any software installation ***/
<br>**sudo apt autoremove**

/*** To re-install Software Center(In left, there is orange bag with name 'Ubuntu Software'): ***/
<br>**sudo apt-get update**
<br>**sudo apt install software-center**

/*** some packages werenâ€™t installed properly. To fix this problem: ***/
<br>**sudo apt-get autoclean**
<br>(clears out the local repository of retrieved package files, but unlike apt-get clean, it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless.)

/*** One of the most basic fixes to resolve dependencies problems is to run: ***/
<br>**sudo apt-get -f install**

/*** Apache server command: ***/
<br>**sudo service apache2 status**
<br>**sudo service apache2 start**
<br>**sudo service apache2 stop**
<br>**sudo service apache2 restart**

/*** MySQL server command: ***/
<br>**sudo service mysql status**
<br>**sudo service mysql start**
<br>**sudo service mysql stop**

/*** Get installed php version: ***/
<br>**php -v**
